# ERC20
Using either Truffle or Hardhat, write implementation of ERC-20 protocol in solidity. You
can refer to the official specification of ERC-20 at
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md.
Note: You have to implement the complete protocol yourself with full coverage without using
any solidity libraries/helpers.
